This is a small vending machine project.
The "vending machine", reads the current inventory from a file, gets the user's inserted amount of money, and displayed the available products.
Then the user can choose a product and if the amount is enough, a purchase goes through, and the level of the item inventory  goes down by one.
The project uses Spring DI.
